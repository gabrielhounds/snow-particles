# Snow-Particles

Dom based snow particle animation class. Create festive snowfall in any dom element! But yeah, it's DOM based... so we're dealing with a bunch of divs. Like hundreds of divs.

Example in [Sparkfow](https://bit.ly/2RITRb9)  

### Depends on GSAP

* [TweenMax](https://greensock.com/docs/TweenMax) 
* [Physics2D plugin](https://greensock.com/Physics2DPlugin) [the minified file includes the Physics2D plugin]

### Creating snow is easy! Just make a new Snow instance:

```
var snow = new Snow({ target:'anyDomElement', intensity:1, pause:true});
```

### There are a few optional parameters for customization.

#### target 
```string``` : Pass a string representing a path to any block level DOM element. Default is ```"body"```

#### intensity
```integer``` : Pass a whole number between 1-3 to increase the number of snow particles. Default is 1.

#### pause 
```boolean``` : Setting ```true``` will pause animation when window loses focus. Default is ```false```. You should probably set to ```true``` so you don't melt proples computers.

#### img1 & img2
```string``` : If you want to use your own snowflakes just provide a valid path to up to two images like ```img1:'img1.png'``` If not, there is a pair of default images all ready to go in some fast & robust Amazon S3 servers.
