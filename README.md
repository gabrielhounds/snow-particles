# Snow-Particles

Dom based snow particle animation class. Create festive snowfall inside any element! Climate change is no concern!

The goal was to create a responsive, lightweight and reusable DOM based particle system for snowfall with an emphasis on simulated depth with parallax motion and depth of field blur. Since this uses the DOM you are going to inject several hundred ```<div>``` elements into your document. This may not be appropriate for your project.

### Making snow is easy - just create a new Snow instance:

```
var snow = new Snow({ target:'anyDOMElement', intensity:1, pause:true});
```

### There are a few optional parameters for customization. 

#### target 
```string``` - Pass a string representing a path to any block level DOM element. Default is ```"body"```

#### intensity
```integer``` - Pass a whole number between 1-3 to increase the number of snow particles. Default is 1.

#### pause 
```boolean``` - Setting ```true``` will pause animation when window loses focus. Default is ```false```. You should probably set to ```true``` so you don't melt prople's computers.

#### img1 & img2
```string``` - If you want to use your own snowflakes just provide a valid path to up to two images like ```img1:'img1.png'``` If not, there is a pair of default images all ready to go in some fast & robust Amazon S3 servers.
